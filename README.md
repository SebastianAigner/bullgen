#### Generating the next generation of slidedecks.
Disrupting Slidedecks.

### Motivation
A lot of talk and little content: Whether it be out-of-this-world pitch presentations or people playing PowerPoint Karaoke, it is undisputed that those who have a lot to talk about need to be backed by a solid set of slides. **bullgen** provides an out-of-the box solution to create a wide variety of tech-like slidedecks.

### Implementation
The initial version of **bullgen** was developed during the _hackaTUM 2017_ hackathon within one and a half days by [Sebastian Aigner](https://github.com/SebastianAigner), [Anselm Eickhoff](https://github.com/aeickhoff) and [Veronika Eickhoff](https://github.com/VeronikaEickhoff).

It leverages _Kotlin_ and _Thymeleaf_ as well as a few other libraries to generate _reveal.js_ presentations that can be run in any or all webbrowsers. We tap into public APIs to enrich our presentations with images, topical quotes, and further information. This will give you _the best automatically generated slidedecks yet™️._

_A lot of industries need a disruption. What should that be? It's, at least somewhat, up to you._
